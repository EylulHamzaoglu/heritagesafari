## Introduction

**Heritage Safari** is a centralized web platform designed to revolutionize the way cultural enthusiasts explore museums and historical sites globally. In today's digital age, finding reliable and comprehensive information about cultural heritage sites can be challenging due to the scattered nature of data across various platforms. Heritage Safari aims to address this issue by offering a unified platform that not only simplifies the discovery and exploration process but also enriches the user experience with detailed site profiles, an informative blog, a comprehensive event calendar, and an intuitive reservation system.
